70. Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        memo = {}

        def helper(n):
            if n in memo:
                return memo[n]
            
            elif n == 1:
                res = 1
            elif n == 2:
                res = 2
            else:
                res = helper(n-1) + helper(n-2)
            
            memo[n] = res
            return res
        
        return helper(n)
```
