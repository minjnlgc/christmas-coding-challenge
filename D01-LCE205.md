205. Isomorphic Strings

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

```python
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        
        s_to_t = {}
        t_to_s = {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            c1 = s[i]
            c2 = t[i]

            if c1 not in s_to_t and c2 not in t_to_s:
                s_to_t[c1] = c2
                t_to_s[c2] = c1

            # if you use [] to access value using a key that is not present in dict, it would raise a KeyError
            # use get() instead
            elif not (s_to_t.get(c1) == c2 and t_to_s.get(c2) == c1):
                return False
            
        return True
