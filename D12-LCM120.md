120. Triangle

Given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTotal(self, triangle: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # longer than the last level by 1
        # this list would store the 'previous' level/row
        dp = [0] * (len(triangle) + 1)

        # iterate the triangle from the bottom to the top
        for level in triangle[::-1]:
            # iterate the level
            for i, n in enumerate(level):
                # store the minimum sum of the value in the current row and adjacent value previous row (stored in dp)
                dp[i] = n + min(dp[i], dp[i+1])
        
        return dp[0]
```

Save more space:
use the last arr in the triangle as dp[] to store values
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTotal(self, triangle: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # last row in triangle
        dp = triangle[-1] 

        # iterate from the second-to-last row
        for row in triangle[-2::-1]: 

            for i, n in enumerate(row):
                dp[i] = n + min(dp[i], dp[i+1])

        return dp[0]
```
